/**
 * <p>
 * The Hash table section of the MPQ archives.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Instead of storing file names, for quick access MoPaQs use a fixed, power of
 * two-size hash table of files in the archive. A file is uniquely identified by
 * its file path, its language, and its platform.<br>
 * <br>
 * The home entry for a file in the hash table is computed as a hash of the file
 * path. In the event of a collision (the home entry is occupied by another
 * file), progressive overflow is used, and the file is placed in the next
 * available hash table entry. Searches for a desired file in the hash table
 * proceed from the home entry for the file until either the file is found, the
 * entire hash table is searched, or an empty hash table entry (FileBlockIndex
 * of 0xFFFFFFFF) is encountered.<br>
 * <br>
 * The hash table is always encrypted, using the hash of "(hash table)" as the
 * key.<br>
 * <br>
 * Prior to Starcraft 2, the hash table is stored uncompressed. In Starcraft 2,
 * however, the table may optionally be compressed. If the offset of the block
 * table is not equal to the offset of the hash table plus the uncompressed
 * size, Starcraft 2 interprets the hash table as being compressed (not
 * imploded). This calculation assumes that the block table immediately follows
 * the hash table, and will fail or crash otherwise.<br>
 * <br>
 * Each entry is structured as follows (see below):
